D3 Visualization:

In our application we followed two Design Principles that we learned from class. Specifically, Visibility and Feedback. When the user goes to the Visualize Data page after he or she logs in to our application via Facebook, the user is able to see quantitative data illustrating how many of the user's friends are Single or In A Relationship and these statistics are further broken down into numbers based on gender. In terms of visibility, when the user clicks on Visualize Data, he or she is met with a system status indicator saying "Loading your profile data..." before the application loads the infographic. With regard to Feedback, the user is able to interact with the infographic and zoom in on different subsets of the data being displayed by clicking on the different sections of the graph.
